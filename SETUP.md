# Setup Instructions

## Project Initialization Complete

The project structure has been successfully created with all necessary configuration files.

## Next Steps

To complete the setup, you need to install the dependencies. Due to PowerShell execution policy restrictions, please run the following command in your terminal:

### Option 1: Using CMD (Command Prompt)
```cmd
npm install
```

### Option 2: Using PowerShell with Bypass
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
npm install
```

### Option 3: Using PowerShell Admin
Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
Then run:
```powershell
npm install
```

## After Installation

Once dependencies are installed, you can:

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Run linting:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Format code:**
   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

## Project Structure Created

✅ React TypeScript project with Vite
✅ Tailwind CSS configuration
✅ shadcn/ui setup with components.json
✅ ESLint configuration
✅ Prettier configuration
✅ TypeScript configurations (tsconfig.json, tsconfig.node.json)
✅ Folder structure:
  - src/components/ (auth, layout, tools, ui)
  - src/services/api/
  - src/store/
  - src/utils/
  - src/hooks/
  - src/types/
  - src/lib/

## Verification

After running `npm install`, verify the setup by:
1. Running `npm run dev` - should start the development server
2. Opening http://localhost:5173 in your browser
3. You should see "Developer Toolkit" with "Project structure initialized"

## Requirements Satisfied

This setup satisfies requirements:
- **1.1**: Unified toolkit interface foundation
- **1.3**: Accessibility-ready structure with semantic HTML and ARIA support via shadcn/ui
